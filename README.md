This is under the "Etch-A-Sketch" project from The Odin Project. Not a simple project, I have to spent 2 ~ 3 days to get all the things running. 
There are quite a lot of repetitive code inside which I probably will revisit it some other time after I gain more knowlegde along the way.
Nevertheless, this project is up and running and I am really proud of it.
